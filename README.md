# Mission-to-Mars

## Objects

Automate a web browser to scrape, or extract data, after this we must visualize and analyze the data. Simplify our day to day and leave behind a manually search.

- Describe basic HyperText Markup Language (HTML) elements.
- Explain how websites use HTML to structure a webpage.
- Explain how Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) uses the class and id attributes to style HTML elements and identify the components of a webpage for scraping.
- Use Beautiful Soup and Splinter to both automate a web browser and scrape data.
- Visualize and analyze scraped data by using Python tools.

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News.

With the support of Jupyter Notebook we worked in the code to scrape the Mars News website, as well as inspect the page to identify elements to scrape.

We made a list of our "title" and "preview", and previousy saved it in a csv file.

## Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data.

We exported our Jupyter notebook file into a Python script. Using this script as the starting point, we started to define the scraping process using Visual Studio Code to edit our Python script. We added functions to scrape through the website(s) and loop through the HTML tags to return the information used to create a database to be stored in.

By performing in-depth analysis of our mission to mars challenge, we are able to identify how many months it has, what is the highest and lowest temperature, what is its pressure? Among many other important factors.
